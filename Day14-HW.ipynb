    "**Q1:** I believe that there is an unconcious bias in algorithms. It's true that algorithms are purely factual, so if the information that it's recieving has a slight bias, than it makes sense why the algorithm itself continues to be bias. Personally, I belive that this is a huge minus in depending on algorithms to make decisions in the human world. Algorithms don't have a brain or moral compass so it run its analysis in a (sometimes offensive) straight-forward manner. However, I believe that there is also a plus on relying on algorithms to make decisions. Since the algorithms are a form of software than it can run analysis, form hypothesis, probabilities, and more so much faster than any human could. Simply, algorithms save us time. "

    "**Q2:** Personally, I train myself to make the right decisions and stay ethical about my data since I have a moral compass and I know that it would be wrong. If I have data that I created and I haven't taken into account any confouding variables than I know there's a possibility that my data isn't accurate. So, I try my hardest to find that coufounding variable, or at least find research about it. Additionally, if I create data and I'm not 100% sure of my findings, I won't report it. I do my best to remain neutral at all times because I shouldn't have a personal bias about my data or I'll be unethical. "

If given the opportunity, I would inform them of their bias and, if we researched the same topic, I would share my findings with them. I understand that somtimes having a bias in your work can be accidental and I would want to give them a \"heads-up\". However, if I try to help them regarding their bias and they don't want to change it than I wouldn't trust them or their work since it's been so clearly affected by their personal bias."

    "1) Criado Perez, Caroline, Invisible Women: Data Bias In A World Designed For Men, Chatto & Windus, 2019\n",
    "2) The book is about the misrepresentation of women in data collecting. For example, something that I found interesting was the reasoning behind why women have a higher probabilty of dying in a car crash as opposed to men. To explain, when the car designers are testing the safety of the car they use testing dummies of the average male height, build, and weight, which completely leave out women. This example basically sums up the kind of misrepresentation that this books touches upon.\n",
    "3)  I was shocked when I read this book because I wasn't expecting this large of a misrepresentation of women in basic data collection. As a woman, I'm now questioning my safety when I see that certain data represent \"mankind\", since this term usually prioritizes male safety. This book made me realize that data isn't fully inclusive and that the ethics of these data collections are faulty. Additionally, I do agree with the author because I've done my own research out of curiosity and realized that what she stated was true. Overall, women are a minority in data collection and aren't fully represented, which threatens their safety. Finally, the ideologies that stood out to me from this book were the faulty car crash reports and the gender pay gap."
